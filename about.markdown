This is the puzzlehunt blogpost of Tim aka Soni aka Harmony's Balls aka Lance aka....

I have been puzzle-hunting with Team Arithmancy since 2021, as well as raging since 1990s. This blog will have plenty of both. You can also find me [editing the Puzzle Wiki](https://www.puzzles.wiki/wiki/User:Soni) or preaching the name of our Lord and Savior Google Sheets in my free time.

This blog will be very stream-of-consciousness, ergo posts will be long. And it will probably contain a lot of my random commentary. [^1]

[^1]: And footnotes. Lots and lots of footnotes. Likely.

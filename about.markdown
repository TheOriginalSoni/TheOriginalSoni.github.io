This is the puzzlehunt blogpost of Tim aka Soni aka Harmony aka Nirma aka TheOriginalSoni aka....

I have been puzzle-hunting with The Mathemagicians since 2021, as well as raging since 1990s. This blog will have plenty of both. You can also find me [editing the Puzzle Wiki](https://www.puzzles.wiki/wiki/User:Soni) or preaching the name of our Lord and Savior Google Sheets in my free time.

This blog will be very stream-of-consciousness, ergo posts will be long. And it will probably contain a lot of my random commentary. [^1] If you see a <span class="spoiler">spoiler</span> just hover over it.

[^1]: And footnotes. Lots and lots of footnotes. Likely.

Hope you enjoy reading this! (And pls do [leave me some feedback](https://discord.com/users/238178647033249792)! I'm usually on discord as `@talesfromtim`).
